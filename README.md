## Introduction

This project offers an exciting opportunity for students to explore the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and collaborative agent-based simulations. Whether you're new to AI or an enthusiast, this project will provide you with hands-on experience in building AI-powered systems.

## Project Goals

**Create an AI microsimulation **

The global vision is to create a microsimulation featuring AI agents that mimic the functionalities of ChatDev in an innovative way. Projects will be rated on 120 points.

**The Zenko Challenge**

Zenko Microsimulation has been designed with the following goals:


**Collaborative Simulation**: Explore the potential of AI agents working collaboratively in a simulated environment.
**GPT Integration**: Showcase the integration of AI agents with  powerful LLM models.
**Versatility Demonstration**: Demonstrate the versatility of AI agents in various domains and tasks, powered by LLM.

**Tasks and Points**
1. Create a virtual agent that handles the role of a director of customer relations (100 points)
2. Integrate this virtual agent in a microsimulation environment (10 points)
3. Add more virtual agents in this environment (10 points)

## Rules and Guidelines

Hackathon registration closes on October 20st.

The hackathon starts on Saturday, October 21 at 1:00 PM UCT+3 and ends on Sunday, October 22 at 1:00 PM UTC +3.

After every project is presented, the jury will shortly select and announce the best projects.





### Rules for Project submission

Your project must be an MIT-licensed public GitHub repository.

Each submission will be cloned on Sunday, October 22 at 12:59 PM UTC+3 and will then be evaluated by the jury during the next days.No changes will be possible after this date.

Each group must communicate their GitHub repository URL through Discord.

An explicit [README.md](https://www.notion.so/Zenko-Hackathon-2023-fb46deadba324852acf1ea7fdffc9145?pvs=21) must be written and a 3-5 min presentation, in English, will be used by the jury to understand your project and its use.

Donâ€™t forget that the delivery of this project consist of two things: your technical delivery and your pitch presentation.
The jury will have only a limited time to evaluate the teams projects and this presentation will be really important in order to do so.

During the demonstration of your delivery, you will be judged on various points such as:

- The quality of the agent(s)
- The methodology that you used
- The ambitions you had regarding the final objective
- Clarity and objectivity in the presentation/documentation
