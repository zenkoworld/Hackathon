## Introduction

This project offers an exciting opportunity for students to explore the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and collaborative agent-based simulations. Whether you're new to AI or an enthusiast, this project will provide you with hands-on experience in building AI-powered systems.

## Project Goals

The Zenko Challenge Microsimulation has been designed with the following goals:

1. **Collaborative Simulation**: Explore the potential of AI agents working collaboratively in a simulated environment.
2. **GPT Integration**: Showcase the integration of AI agents with the powerful GPT model.
3. **Learning Platform**: Provide a platform for students to experiment with AI agent development and integration.
4. **Versatility Demonstration**: Demonstrate the versatility of AI agents in various domains and tasks, guided by GPT.

## Potential Project Focuses

Participants are encouraged to select one of the suggested project focuses below or come up with a related innovative idea of their own. Each focus provides a concept, its applications, and the challenges associated with it.

### 1. Event Planning and Optimization Agent

**Concept:**

- **Objective:** Create an autonomous agent that assists in planning and optimizing events based on target demographics, current trends, and budget constraints.
- **Functionality:** Analyze previous event data, predict attendee preferences, and provide recommendations for event themes, venues, and schedules.
- **Application:** Conferences, weddings, corporate events, and festivals.

**Challenges:**
- Accurately predicting attendee preferences and adapting to changing trends.
- Integrating with various vendor systems for seamless event planning.

### 2. Venue Recommender System

**Concept:**

- **Objective:** Design an agent that recommends event venues based on specific requirements such as capacity, ambiance, facilities, and location.
- **Functionality:** Analyze user requirements, cross-reference available venues, and provide top recommendations.
- **Application:** Event organizers, individuals, and corporations looking for suitable venues.

**Challenges:**
- Keeping an updated database of venues with real-time availability and features.
- Handling diverse user preferences and requirements.

### 3. Dynamic Event Promotion and Engagement

**Concept:**

- **Objective:** Implement an agent that autonomously promotes events to targeted audiences and engages potential attendees through personalized interactions.
- **Functionality:** Identify target demographics, design tailored promotional content, and distribute it across various platforms.
- **Application:** Event marketing for concerts, exhibitions, conferences, and more.

**Challenges:**
- Crafting compelling promotional content that resonates with diverse audiences.
- Real-time tracking of promotional campaign effectiveness and making necessary adjustments.

### 4. Guest Experience Enhancer

**Concept:**

- **Objective:** Build an agent focused on enhancing the guest experience at hospitality establishments like hotels, resorts, and restaurants.
- **Functionality:** Analyze guest feedback, preferences, and behaviors to recommend personalized services, amenities, or activities.
- **Application:** Hotels, resorts, restaurants, and other hospitality establishments.

**Challenges:**
- Ensuring guest privacy while collecting and analyzing data.
- Integrating with various hotel management systems for real-time service optimization.

### 5. Event Feedback and Improvement Agent

**Concept:**

- **Objective:** Design an autonomous agent that collects feedback from event attendees in real-time and provides actionable insights for immediate improvement.
- **Functionality:** Gather feedback through interactive surveys, social media monitoring, and direct interactions; analyze the data and suggest areas of improvement.
- **Application:** Any event aiming for continuous improvement, from small gatherings to large-scale conferences.

**Challenges:**
- Designing effective real-time feedback mechanisms that don't disrupt the attendee experience.
- Rapidly analyzing feedback data and generating actionable insights during the course of the event.
