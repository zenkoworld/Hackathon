## Potential Project Focuses

Participants are encouraged to select one of the suggested project focuses below or come up with a related innovative idea of their own. Each focus provides a concept, its applications, and the challenges associated with it.

### 1. Event Planning and Optimization Agent

**Concept:**

- **Objective:** Create an autonomous agent that assists in planning and optimizing events based on target demographics, current trends, and budget constraints.
- **Functionality:** Analyze previous event data, predict attendee preferences, and provide recommendations for event themes, venues, and schedules.
- **Application:** Conferences, weddings, corporate events, and festivals.

**Challenges:**
- Accurately predicting attendee preferences and adapting to changing trends.
- Integrating with various vendor systems for seamless event planning.



### 2. Dynamic Event Promotion and Engagement

**Concept:**

- **Objective:** Implement an agent that autonomously promotes events to targeted audiences and engages potential attendees through personalized interactions.
- **Functionality:** Identify target demographics, design tailored promotional content, and distribute it across various platforms.
- **Application:** Event marketing for concerts, exhibitions, conferences, and more.

**Challenges:**
- Crafting compelling promotional content that resonates with diverse audiences.
- Real-time tracking of promotional campaign effectiveness and making necessary adjustments.

### 3. Guest Experience Enhancer

**Concept:**

- **Objective:** Build an agent focused on enhancing the guest experience at hospitality establishments like hotels, resorts, and restaurants.
- **Functionality:** Analyze guest feedback, preferences, and behaviors to recommend personalized services, amenities, or activities.
- **Application:** Hotels, resorts, restaurants, and other hospitality establishments.

**Challenges:**
- Ensuring guest privacy while collecting and analyzing data.

## Submission


Donâ€™t forget that the delivery of this project consist of two things: your technical delivery and your pitch presentation.
The jury will have only a limited time to evaluate the teams projects and this presentation will be really important in order to do so.

### âœ…Â Review session:

**We are doing a project review session 6 hours after the hackathon starts (6:00 PM UTC+3 on Oct, 21th) ! Also mandatory ðŸ˜‰
The goal of this session is to do a technical follow-up, clarify and facilitate the development of your project.**
