## Potential Project Focuses

Participants are encouraged to select one of the suggested project focuses below or come up with a related innovative idea of their own. Each focus provides a concept, its applications, and the challenges associated with it.

### 1. Event Planning and Optimization Agent

**Concept:**

- **Objective:** Create an autonomous agent that assists in planning and optimizing events based on target demographics, current trends, and budget constraints.
- **Functionality:** Analyze previous event data, predict attendee preferences, and provide recommendations for event themes, venues, and schedules.
- **Application:** Conferences, weddings, corporate events, and festivals.

**Challenges:**
- Accurately predicting attendee preferences and adapting to changing trends.
- Integrating with various vendor systems for seamless event planning.



### 2. Dynamic Event Promotion and Engagement

**Concept:**

- **Objective:** Implement an agent that autonomously promotes events to targeted audiences and engages potential attendees through personalized interactions.
- **Functionality:** Identify target demographics, design tailored promotional content, and distribute it across various platforms.
- **Application:** Event marketing for concerts, exhibitions, conferences, and more.

**Challenges:**
- Crafting compelling promotional content that resonates with diverse audiences.
- Real-time tracking of promotional campaign effectiveness and making necessary adjustments.

### 3. Guest Experience Enhancer

**Concept:**

- **Objective:** Build an agent focused on enhancing the guest experience at hospitality establishments like hotels, resorts, and restaurants.
- **Functionality:** Analyze guest feedback, preferences, and behaviors to recommend personalized services, amenities, or activities.
- **Application:** Hotels, resorts, restaurants, and other hospitality establishments.

**Challenges:**
- Ensuring guest privacy while collecting and analyzing data.
- Integrating with various hotel management systems for real-time service optimization.

## Rules and Guidelines

### Rules for Project submission

Your project must be an MIT-licensed public GitHub repository.

Each submission will be cloned on Sunday, October 22 at 12:59 PM UTC+3 and will then be evaluated by the jury during the next days.

No changes will be possible after this date.
Each group must communicate their GitHub repository URL through Discord.
An explicit [README.md](https://www.notion.so/Zenko-Hackathon-2023-fb46deadba324852acf1ea7fdffc9145?pvs=21) must be written and a 3-5 min presentation, in English, will be used by the jury to understand your project and its use.

## Submission


Donâ€™t forget that the delivery of this project consist of two things: your technical delivery and your pitch presentation.
The jury will have only a limited time to evaluate the teams projects and this presentation will be really important in order to do so.

### âœ…Â Review session:

**We are doing a project review session 6 hours after the hackathon starts (6:00 PM UTC+3 on Oct, 21th) ! Also mandatory ðŸ˜‰
The goal of this session is to do a technical follow-up, clarify and facilitate the development of your project.**
